# News Category Classification using NLP and Machine Learning

## Problem Statement
Automatically categorizing news articles helps media platforms organize content, improve search, and personalize user experiences.
The objective of this project is to classify news articles into predefined categories using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
Publicly available news dataset containing article text and corresponding category labels.
The dataset represents real-world news content across multiple domains.

## Approach
- Text cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature extraction using Bag-of-Words / TF-IDF
- Train-test split for evaluation
- Machine learning models for multi-class classification
- Performance evaluation using appropriate metrics

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

Multi-class evaluation is used to assess classification performance across different news categories.

## Key Insights
- Text preprocessing significantly impacts classification accuracy
- TF-IDF effectively represents news article content
- Some categories are more difficult to distinguish due to overlapping vocabulary
- Multi-class classification requires careful metric interpretation

## Limitations
- Contextual meaning and sarcasm are difficult to capture
- Performance depends on dataset balance and quality
- Not suitable for production deployment without further tuning
